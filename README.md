# 5 Languages

## What is this project?

#### This project is pretty simple. We are going to have a Register/Login system. You can register and you can login in accounts. Now everything is stored in assets as files.

## Why?

### I'm doing this project on 5 languages. C, C++, C#, Rust and Python. The reason why i do this is really to test my skills on these programming languages.

## How to run?

#### First of all you need to make a folder for the git repository, you can create a folder with the mouse or with the terminal (or cmd on windows) with this: 
```
mkdir languages-5
cd languages-5
```

#### Now you can clone the repository by going to a terminal (or cmd on windows) with this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Izu83/5-Languages
```
And boom you have the repository

### C
First of all you need the C compiler (gcc or clang), you can install it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)!

If you have Makefile you can just open a terminal in the place where the main.c is and you can run this:

```
make
```

but if you dont have tMakefile, you can run this in the terminal:
```
gcc main.c -o app.exe
.\app.exe
```

### C++
First of all you need the C++ compiler (g++ or clang), you can install it from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)!

If you have Makefile you can just open a terminal in the place where the main.cpp is and you can run this:

```
make
```

but if you dont have Makefile, you can run this in the terminal:
```
g++ main.cpp -o app.exe
.\app.exe
```

### C#
First of all you need [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), or you can setup [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for C#.

If you have Makefile you can just open a terminal in the place where the Program.cs is and you can run this:

```
make
```

but if you dont have Makefile, you can run this in the terminal:
```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

### Rust
First of all you need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and you need Cargo, but Cargo installs with Rust.

You need to run this in the terminal:
```
cargo run
```

### Python
First of all you need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After that if you have Makefile you can just run:
```
make
```

but if you dont have Makefile, you can just run:

```
python main.py
```
